# My New and Improved Personal Website~!
I built a new personal website based on the new technologies, skills, and methods I picked up. I put this together from scratch and keep it updated.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I built this from scratch based on a *gasp* template I saw. I wanted to recreate it with HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I could work on mastering and applying the fundamentals. I am incredibly happy with what I have.

## Optimizations

I cut out some fancy JS animations to reduce load time and bloat with my website. Originally, I had more fancy animations but it started to slow down the load time [oof]. I found that using CSS animations were a bit better. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that good front-end is not just something that looks great to engineers, but to lay-man folx too. You got to make things as simply and easy to navigate as possible. I had realized adding prompts, clickable elements, and directing the user to other parts of the website they usually wouldn't go to were necessary to make sure that my website is easy to navigate.
